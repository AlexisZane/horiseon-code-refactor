This is a refactoring of original source code for a fictional company called Horiseon. It is written in HTML and CSS.
You will find amendments to the original source code which were made to increase accessibility for those who have screen readers, as well as to increase readability for future developers. I have fixed any nonfunctional links and completed the necessary tests to ensure that all images are displaying correctly. I have added notation to the code in order to explain my thinking. 
As a note to my instructional team, I would like to say that the css file that index.html is routing to is contained inside the 'Develop' folder. I learned a great deal throughout this exercise about file pathing and the impact it can have on your project as it matures. Although the current layout is slightly unorthodox, know that it facilitated many important learning opportunities that will stick with me.
